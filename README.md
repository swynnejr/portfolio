This is my Protfolio and Blog. It is a React project utilizing [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) version 13. It uses Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion for styling and animation. I am also using [Sanity.io](https://sanity.io/) as a CMS and Sanity Studio allows me to modify my content from any browser using [Sanity Studio](https://www.swynne.com/studio) 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
